an Individual Representation of the source for later location estimation
MCC, MNC, LAC, CI (for celltowers)
MAC (for WiFi hotspots)
a Timestampin CFAbsoluteTime format
when the location information of the device was retrieved,  that is, when location services were used and the location daemon needs to be updated.
the Location of the device
Latitude, Longitude,
the Horizontal- and Vertical- Accuracyof the device
to be interpreted as the transmitter range of the device (therefore celltowers do not transmit vertical, so the value is -1.0, many WiFi hotspots do have more than one antenna to provide a more all around transmitting range)
the Altitudeof the device
the Altitude of celltowers is 0, because the greater divergence resulting of a higher transmitting range
Speed / Course
not used
and the Confidenceof the source
to be interpreted as the reliability of the source
50-70 for celltowers, maybe in relation to the consolidation experience from Apple
50, “to be or not to be”, or 50% of reliability
